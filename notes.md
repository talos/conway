r## Misc

* We need automatic reminder
* We need bigger text for the __time__ in class description

## Homework

* copy/paste all code in to get it going at home
* review code before next class to refamiliarize yourself
* think of three visual ideas you'd like to explore via the game of life

## Homework for me

* Look into CSS scaling & eliminate gnarly scaling code
* Look into animation capturing
* Look into ways that rules can be bent
* Better ways of turning arbitrary text input into some values


## Options for next class

* experimentation with color !!!
 - blends, fps, palettes etc.
* experimentation with rules (within reason, gentle guidance)
* experimentation with input methods
* play with overlays/ bringing in a separate image as both input or overlay

## Other art ideas

* Deforming image with altered rules of life -- so that it's a gradual
  deformation that lets the image through for some time
