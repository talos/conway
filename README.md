# Cellular automata!

1. Open up a new [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net).
2. Copy the contents of
   [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talos/conway/gh-pages/index.html)
   into the "HTML" section of the Fiddle.
3. For each of the sections below, copy the appropriate code in as we review it
   to build up the pieces of the simulation.

# The components

## [Canvas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talos/conway/gh-pages/canvas.js)

functions that make it easier for us to draw to it.

## [Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talos/conway/gh-pages/data.js)

Initialize objects that store the data necessary for game state, as well as
functions that alter that game state through time.
